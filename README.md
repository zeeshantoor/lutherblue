#Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JS, AJAX

#Guidelines:

For this project we are expecting the following outcomes: 

- Pixel Perfect Conversion of Figma Prototype (Desktop and Mobile) to HTML/CSS/JS-JQuery/PHP
- Wordpress/WooCommerce: All elements in the UI must be connected to either ACF Fields or Product Page Hooks
- All product Page UI elements need to be functional: Variant Selector, Gallery Image Picker, AJAX add to Cart, Similar Product Slider (& add to cart on hover), Accordions
- Fonts from the project need to be used in the technical test. Pay attention to color and sizes.
- EXCELLENT usage of grid and Front End programming principles are a MUST (proper usage of IDâ€™s, class names, helper classes, alignments, padding, margins, font hierarchy, etc...)
- Responsive styling is also a part of the test. Pay attention to functionality changes on mobile.

Kindly focus more on the following points.. 

- Filter for size/price
- Carousel
- Mobile responsive
- Margin & padding
- Standard Transitions
